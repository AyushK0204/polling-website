## üöÄ Technologies Used & Justification

### Frontend

| Technology | Justification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | Chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes building complex and reusable UI elements efficient and manageable. |
| **Vite** | Selected as the build tool for its incredibly fast development server and optimized production builds. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Used for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid and consistent styling directly within the HTML. |
| **React Router** | The standard for handling client-side routing and navigation in a modern single-page application. |
| **Axios** | A promise-based HTTP client for making reliable and clean requests to the backend API. |

### Backend

| Technology | Justification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Node.js & Express** | A classic combination for building fast, scalable, and lightweight backend APIs, all within the JavaScript ecosystem. |
| **MongoDB** | A flexible NoSQL database, chosen for its ease of use with JavaScript and its ability to store complex, nested data like poll options. |
| **Mongoose** | Provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data, enforce validation, and manage business logic. |
| **JWT** | Implemented for secure, stateless authentication, stored in `httpOnly` cookies for enhanced security against XSS attacks. |
| **bcryptjs** | Used to hash user passwords before storing them, ensuring user data security. |

* A `User` can create many `Polls` (One-to-Many via `createdBy`).
* Many `Users` can vote on many `Polls` (Many-to-Many via `votedBy`).
